# Flight Delay Prediction

This work was done as a part of a team project for DBA5106 - Foundations
of Business Analytics offered by National University of Singapore during
Academic Year 2022/2023 Semester 1.

## Description

In this project, we try to resolve the flight delay problem with approaches 
used to build flight delay prediction models through supervised learning.
We used the definition of delay to mean that the actual departure time is 
30 minutes more than the scheduled departure time. 

Flight delay costs can be represented through direct airline costs such 
as labour expenses, fuel costs, as well as maintenance and aircraft ownership.
Indirect costs affecting consumers costs are loss of trust and compromised 
labour productivity for business travellers

The business application for this project is to help:
1. Airlines to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction
2. Airports increase flight efficiency
3. Passengers to get more accurate updates regarding their flights  
through predicting a delay.
